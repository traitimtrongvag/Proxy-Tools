Get Proxy

The get proxy section helps users collect proxies from public sources. The tool uses Python to automatically gather a list of proxies from websites that provide free proxies and saves them into the file Andeptrai.txt. Each proxy includes an IP address and port, with common types such as HTTP, HTTPS, or SOCKS.

The workflow of this section includes:

Accessing and collecting proxies from proxy-providing websites.

Storing the proxy list in the file Andeptrai.txt, each proxy on a separate line.


Filter Proxy

After collecting the proxy list, the filter proxy section helps remove unsafe, unstable, or insecure proxies. Filtering criteria can include:

Safety check: Verify whether the proxy supports secure connections (HTTPS).

Speed check: Remove proxies with slow or unstable response times.

Availability check: Ensure the proxy can connect successfully and maintain a stable connection.


This filtering step ensures that users keep only high-quality, reliable proxies suitable for security requirements.
